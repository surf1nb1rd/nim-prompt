# nim-prompt

![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

A library for building powerful interactive prompts inspired by [python-prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit), making it easier to build cross-platform command line tools using Nim.

#### Projects using nim-prompt

* [nim-chronicles](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronicles/). The log filtering tool `chronicles_tail` was the original
project that lead to the creation of this library.

## Features

### Powerful auto-completion

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The provided shortcuts should be familiar to most Windows, macOS and Linux users.

<kbd>Tab</kbd>                                        | Trigger auto-complete, Select next completion
<kbd>Ctrl + L</kbd>                                   | Clear the screen
<kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl + J</kbd>                 | Accept line

### History

You can use <kbd>Up arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down arrow</kbd> to walk through the history of commands executed.
An optional history file can be specified for each user program.

### Unicode aware

nim-prompt will correctly handle and display all unicode characters. In the public API, all procs use UTF-8 encoded
strings on all platforms.

### Multiple platform support

We have confirmed nim-prompt works fine in the following terminals:

* iTerm2, Terminal.app (macOS)
* Command Prompt (Windows)
* gnome-terminal (Ubuntu)

### Live-colorized output

By registering a procedure that can transform the output of the prompt it is possible to colour the user input live as
they type. Just make sure not to change the length of the output as that messes with the cursor position identifier.
